We were given data that provides information about various schools, including their type, total students, 
total school budget, per student budget, average math score, average reading score, percentage of students passing math, 
percentage of students passing reading, and overall passing percentage. 
Based on the data, the highest performing schools are all charter schools. 
Cabrera High School has the highest overall passing percentage of 91.33%, followed by Thomas High School (90.95%), 
Griffin High School (90.60%), Wilson High School (90.58%), and Pena High School (90.54%). 
These schools also have higher average math and reading scores compared to the district schools.
While the bottom performing schools are all district schools. 
Rodriguez High School has the lowest overall passing percentage of 52.99%, followed by Figueroa High School (53.20%), 
Huang High School (53.51%), Hernandez High School (53.53%), and Johnson High School (53.54%). 
These schools also have lower average math and reading scores compared to the charter schools.


Conclusion
1. We can then say  that charter schools tend to perform better academically compared to district schools. 
Charter schools have higher overall passing percentages and average scores in both math and reading.

2. The highest-performing schools have lower per student budgets compared to the bottom-performing schools. 
This indicates that a higher budget per student does not necessarily guarantee better academic performance.
